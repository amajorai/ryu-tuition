//! Process shell for `ryu-tuition`.
//!
//! Three modes, decided before anything binds a port:
//!
//! - `ryu-tuition mcp` — serve the MCP protocol on stdin/stdout and exit. **Nothing
//!   binds a listener in this mode**, so several MCP clients can run their own copy.
//! - `ryu-tuition` — serve HTTP on loopback, behind the bearer gate.
//! - either — the store is opened and migrated first, so a schema problem is a
//!   startup failure rather than a 500 on the first request.
//!
//! # The four constants
//!
//! Two of these must match `apps-store/tuition/manifest.json` byte-for-byte and
//! **nothing checks them at compile time** (the other two, the plugin id and the
//! event ids, live in `state.rs` and are checked there):
//!
//! - [`DEFAULT_PORT`] == `sidecars[0].port`. Drift means Core probes a port nobody is
//!   listening on and reports the sidecar unhealthy while it happily serves.
//! - [`MOUNT`] == `sidecars[0].http.mount`. Drift means Core forwards
//!   `/api/tuition/skills` to a router that only knows `/skills`.
//!
//! `api.rs` asserts both against the manifest, which is the only reason they are safe.
//!
//! # No graceful shutdown, deliberately
//!
//! Core owns this process's lifecycle. What the shutdown path DOES do is abort the
//! background tick before returning, so a supervised restart never briefly runs two
//! ticks against one database.
